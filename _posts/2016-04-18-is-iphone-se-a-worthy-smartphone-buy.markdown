<p>The tech world came to a resounding stop when the iPhone SE was released a few weeks ago, becoming a part of the new iPhone 6 series. Few can marginalize and criticize the beauty that iPhone has bought to the table. They could have easily changed their position to bring an equal size smartphone but chose to pay attention to the one third of its Apple users who are still using the iPhone 5S. All in all, to move away from that obsolete set to the SE (Special Edition) will be quite an accomplishment for any user.</p>

<h1>One Hand Small Screen Set</h1>

<p>The iPhone SE is a thing of beauty that captures the elegance and sophistication of its features in a full 4 inch display. There is a major following of iPhone users who are still clinging to the smaller design and version as it easy to carry and use. The iPhone 6 & 6S provide with incredible size and speed but are not so easily handled and are prone to falling if not used with both hands.</p>

<h1>Performance is Completely Resolute</h1>

<p>When developing a wide variety of smartphones, there is every possibility that they will have performance differences. But Apple has foregone this strategy to give their new and small set the same number of features and uplifted performance rate as that of the iPhone6S. No amount of app storage will in any way decrease the speed of this miracle smartphone.</p>

<h1>Front 12 MP iSight Camera</h1>

<p>Nothing beats the camera results of the iPhone SE that maybe 12 MP but carries so much detail and color in every image capture that is mind boggling. The Live Photos also comes into play with its three second video that is an absolute smasher of a feature … You just can’t beat this camera!!<p>

<h1>Full Day Lasting Battery</h1>

<p>We are talking about using the smartphone for the entire day which includes constant usage of its components. From social media to unlimited calls, this iPhone’s battery was relentless and did not fade out under any circumstances… a worthy buy indeed!!</p>

<p>Given the <a href="http://yayvo.com/mobile-phones.html">mobile phone prices in Pakistan </a> are nowadays, it is still available at quite a moderate price of 50,000 rupees. In case of a previous iPhone 5S user, they can sell and pull together a bit of money with it to get such a priced smartphone.</p>
